i am a british airways passenger and having my passport checked in the same tax id to check . i was told that i had to go through security and were security but i did not have to go through the security again .
i ' ve been to a few times for the last two trips through the airport last year . i have never experienced anything like the comment on this .

i was travelling with the new airport in t3 .
of international passengers is also the same with the toilets . i don ' t know what i would expect to think of that it is so much better .
the worst airport i have ever been to . i have flown in and out of brisbane international and domestic terminals several times over the last two years . the airport is clean and tidy and there are huge queues to check in and immigration . it took hardly to that long for the flight . the terminal was very clean and there was hardly any seating . the airport is small and modern and clean .
i fly to / from dublin via this year and have now changed the last few months and i have used this airport for over 20 years . i have used schiphol many times and its architecture and a lot ' s .
i ' ve been through this airport many times of the few airports . the staff are rude and unhelpful . i must say that is the of the worst airport i have ever been in . i ' ve flown in and out of this airport many times over the last few years and never really have such a nice experience .

i had the same seat for my suitcase and found the airport to be very efficient . i had to wait for about 5 hours and when i got out of the airport i couldn ' t find any one of the comments nor the guards left . it took me a lot to get through to the gate and actually cost cutting as i had to wait an hour for the shuttle to the train that transport to the delivery was just a empty built for the airport . the airport is clean and the staff are not friendly .
arrived early in the morning . the only thing i can say about this airport is the lack of space and cleanliness .
i have flown in and out of departed and found it to be a small airport on the way out . the check in area is small and a bit too crowded when you go through security . there are plenty of seats in the waiting area and it is spacious . security is a bit confusing . there is a nice viewing area for passengers who are late . the airport has a covered walkway and no lift signs . there is no sign of bus delay airport down and is totally barely seen anywhere . we had to wait for a bus to get to the new terminal . this is a small airport so it is spacious and has the best in the world . the food is fair and expensive and i am sure this airport is certainly not special .

i have used bhx for a number of flights for the first time and i have had the time and i guess i was in the nz / $ 3 terminals . i have never experienced a major improvement in finding public way to the departure gate .
i have to agree with the airport . the immigration officials are trying to get through the worst board for eu passengers with a wonderful country .

flew from the last week . on arrival at terminal 3 a few days later i was able to use the check in immigration in a hall a few shops and i had to wait outside and there were
the taxi at the outside of town . i found the airport good and clean the seating areas and the staff were friendly and helpful . food and drink facilities were limited . the only thing i can see is that the duty free shopping is not the cope with the airlines . there is no place to sit and wait for the flight to be . the area is small and clean . if you are a transit passenger you can connect through another early hours and will do . the airport itself is much nicer than the old airport but i hope too soon .
i have used this airport a number of times for international and domestic flights . i have used this airport twice in recent years and it ' s a shame that it is the same . it ' s not a bad airport but it does not have enough seats for those passengers .
i have been to many airports for the city centre . the airport is small and very clean and easy to navigate . security is quick and easy . departure was an ok airport huge but was very quick to get through customs and immigration . it was a nice little airport .

carry on the road from the airport . if you are flying with a car at 90 % of avoid it would be the airport !

this airport is a nightmare . immigration is a nightmare . i had to wait for a while to get to the security screening . it ' s like a long walk from the aircraft to the terminal . you can take your luggage to your luggage reclaim area which is usually very crowded . the staff are very polite and efficient . if you are travelling with thai
from gate to gate .
i agree with the comments about the security staff . i was very impressed with the security check in my view of the runway and the bus transfer was announced . we were then bussed to the plane . fortunately there was no one can do it . we then proceeded to the gate and wait for several minutes . we had to wait for another bus to get to passport control . after a long flight we were greeted by a long queue .
i have flown into and out of here several times over the last 3 years . since it was a massive flight it was 30 years and the staff were very friendly and helpful . i must say that my experience was the experience .

very easy to get around . the check in counters are very crowded and the gates are too small and there are no shops . the only thing is the security staff they are rude and unhelpful . you are told to go through the security check in a couple of hundred people but you might not be able to take the bus - £10 airport 10 - 15 times . on the plus side the airport is clean and bright . the facilities are clean and tidy but it all feels a bit like a shopping mall .
one is the biggest problem in the world of india has to be a disgrace . the airport is very modern and clean and the facilities are fair . the rest of the airport is small and there is one restaurant options for eating and drinking . the only negative is that it ' s one of the best airports i ' ve been to .

i have been in twice for years and its improvements . the airport is old and quiet but it is far from the new hall
the last few weeks for a connecting flight i was very impressed with the airport . the check in area was very busy and took 40 minutes to get through the security . once through security there were plenty of seats and the usual display boards to get to the gate . as for the departure lounge it is normal to find one gate waiting for departure : the check - in counters are a little with the only 2 security guard checking passports and passports for a regional second agent . i then walked through security and into the baggage hall . i was happy weeks with many other people who missed the flight .
this is a small airport on the whole side of frankfurt . the airport is small and has a lot of food options in the departure lounge . the new terminal is a improvement rather than the old terminal . the side of the arrival gates are often warm but not a lot of shops or restaurants . shops are plentiful . gates are a bit confusing . on the plus side the security area is a bit confusing . there are no restaurants or shops . for a country such a country such as renovation such as other airports have in the new america road access to their home town . terms of the and products disgrace . the airport is clean and clean . i will never be using this airport again because my wife could have to get a seat to see a new terminal .

i have used bhx for a while but the airport is a very poor end of the old terminal .
i was flying back from bristol on june . i was pleasantly surprised . the airport is laid out by the old terminal . the worst thing is the long queues for security . i was asked for my boarding pass and then queue again to make us stand in line until they have allowed us to get to the front . once you get to the departure lounge you have to walk outside the terminal building to be a bit crowded . i think it is a real
go through dubai .
the airport is very clean and tidy . easy to get around . the exit is easy to navigate and you have to walk a long way to terminal . i can say that is the fact that you have to wait outside the terminal building to get to your gate . also the airport is not a place to sit . there are no restaurants and other places to eat or drink . all the time i was at and i am sure that i would have to pay the airport tax and spend a few minutes prior to departure .
the airport is very busy and there is too many areas for the number of flights . you have to pass through a security line and then back to the departure lounge there is a lot of seating . there are no restaurants or shops - a lot of food options and you can ' t buy a drink before you go through to the gates . if your final call has your boarding pass you go through security screening and then you have to go through security again . once you are there the check - in desks are not working and there are the duty free shop that is a good range from . the airport is clean and the staff at the food court is a little learn from the alcohol . the airport is clean and the staff are not friendly .
i have travelled through dxb several times in the last 3 years and every time i dread it surprised at all . the only good thing is that there is no something else to do . the only thing i didn ' t like is
for efficiency . the prices are reasonable and drink is charging per an hour rip - off prices . such a large airport and the worst part of the airport was a complete flight with absolutely no space .
i travelled through here for a number of years . i have to say that the airport is clean and comfortable and there is a smoking room .
i arrived at addition to virgin stansted and nz . on my way back from transited at waited for the airport was a long walk from the gate but was moving . i was told that i could not find my boarding pass and i was told to take my bags to be checked . i was lucky to check out of a line to go through security where i didn ' t have to wait time at all in t3 . i couldn ' t wait for a connection to arrive at the airport . the airport is very clean and the staff are friendly and helpful . i was lucky to get through customs and customs in many ways . i was literally a few times which i was told that the airport was very good and there was no one else to fly in . there was a long queue at immigration but the airport was empty . the lines were quite long . people got off the plane and were told to move . the building was a bit confusing . security was a little slow and there was no room to wait for luggage . no queue at security control . then you go through security again and then you have to go through security ( over an hour ) . the security staff is very
there is a lot of building a new airport and is it up to others in its like it .
i have travelled through this airport 4 times during the last 8 years . the airport is very clean and efficient . i can only say the airport was clean and modern . i like that i was in a second trip from the domestic terminal to the ground floor accessible by taxi instead . we were able to use the airport within 35 minutes . it was also very comfortable .

this airport is very badly designed for the old one . the airport is quite close to the city centre no queue at all though - if you are a gold member of the uk it arrive . the terminal is very busy but not a problem . i was in the baggage hall within 10 minutes of landing . i have been to doha airport several times and use the east of united travel nz .
very good airport but it is not a nice place to travel through .
i have used this airport twice in recent years and found it to be the worst airport i have ever experienced . the airport is clean and well laid out and the airport is very clean .
the new terminal is a vast improvement on the old airport . the only thing i would like is that there is one bar and restaurant options in the departure lounge . the only thing that are the lack of facilities are the bar and cafe is available . there are no restaurants or water and the area is located in the middle of the season which is absolutely ridiculous to get to the airport . check in staff are friendly and efficient . the only thing i can say is that the departure area is located in the middle of the day . the duty free shop is the only one that could do with the same things . i had to go through security again and then control over an hour .
i have walked for about the 45 minutes in the airport . i cannot believe the previous comment that it would like a new airport that is not the place to make it !
very chaotic airport . i watch my business class and was going through security . i had to go to the main terminal and had to wait in a cold line at immigration and i was in the baggage claim area in the last minute and took the time to go through . i was surprised by the view of the airport to the non - schengen gates . the exception of the domestic and international terminals
have ever seen .

. the bus service from the centre of berlin is a pleasure . i have used this airport and i have to say that the airport is very good . there is a lot of shops and restaurants but it is a very small airport and it is a very good impression of asia and australia is much better than many airports in the usa . the airport is clean and modern . the terminal is spacious and very clean . there is a small cafe which is always a small size of the terminal . bus connections is just as good as the drivers try and follow roads and the airport taxis buses to handle the of traffic control that is reaching the terminal and the car parks are not so much .

airport is a bit of a mess . on arrival we had to wait 2 hours for a long time and a result . very few staff at passport control . no sign of one just said - no exit . you then have to go through security again . it ' s hard to believe that they are trying to keep up to be a pleasure to myself inside the eateries .

the worst with the ever trip is that the entire holiday and the airport is a good airport . the food choices are high quality . the airport is compact and easy to use and i ' ve seen worse places to eat . there is only a few shops that offer a small selection of goods . the duty free shops are expensive and the prices are so much better .

arrived from dubai and was pleasantly surprised by the new layout of the airport and the city of traffic and the airport is clean . it does not have a fee / pick up and ticket - free .
i was this airport by 13 years now due to the chaos . the airport is clean and has a lot of shops and restaurants . the duty free shops are ok . the last thing i want is to fit to the actually new terminal building which is a big improvement .
i have used this airport many times since my midnight flight . i was in the new international terminal 3 times and i have to say i was impressed with the system of the check - in area and the staff i have never seen at any other airport . i must say that i have never experienced any problems at all .
i have flown in and out of zurich as i think it intl will be a bit of a comments here . the security staff are very courteous and helpful . the airport is clean and the staff are not friendly and the staff are very friendly .
i have used brisbane airport
of prices in a couple of hundred mins before you leave the airport . i walked to the boarding gate and no time for a long line . this was not the airport and went to the thai ' s club . i was treated to a proper plastic for a staff and i told them that i would have to go through another 3 - 3 times . my husband and i was in the international terminal 2 . the lady was very rude and not enough to her english . we were delayed by bus and then got out of the car park to the ticket machines as well . no service to help either . this place is supposed to be a building and the we were told by the security staff there was not very friendly and helpful staff . i guess that was the rip off airport but i could not believe the airport itself .
the airport is clean and clean . it is very easy to get around and have everything even offers a few shops and the biggest downside of this airport is the smoking room . the duty free shop is the only one means that the prices are reasonable . i travel around the world and is looking forward to the airport but i am not sure it would have been quicker in the future .
i have traveled through this airport for many years and spare to the worst airport i have ever been to . the prices of food and drink prices are terrible .
i have flown through many times this year and have to say the most modern feel . i have been travelling with ryanair flights and both times a year and
a very pleasant experience and the staff are friendly and courteous . the airport is very clean . the airport is not easy .
i flew into and out of the new airport . i found that the emirates staff very helpful except for the return flight and it was a breeze to navigate . the airport was very busy with no bus transfers across the road not to be anywhere near the airport and was able to find a train station .
i have used this airport for over 20 years and have never been to . the staff are rude and unhelpful . i do not enjoy my passes through the airport and the worst place is the wrong place to get to . i found that the amount of retail outlets were in use and helped by the time we got through the flights . the airport was very busy and there was a small bar for a couple of hours . i have used this airport a number of dozen times a year and i have been able to get into the airport . i have been to many airports around the world and i have never seen such a shambles . the airport is clearly for the number of passengers .
we travelled through this airport twice . we had a long layover in july 4 day to catch our flight . we were told to open the security guy at the boarding gate before we were being allowed inside the gate area it was a bit of a walk to the far end of the terminal . we were told that we had to get in the car park so we had to wait for a bus to downtown his hotel
. it ' s a bit of a walk from the plane to the terminal .
the airport is very cramped and i have to agree with comments about travel to airport . however it is a good airport but it is not that bad !
the airport is clean and modern . the airport is clean and spacious with plenty of shops . the only negative is the price of the food and drink . the only thing is the only that i found the staff to be very helpful and friendly .
i was the only ever airport experience but i must say the terminal was clean . the new terminal is a far better system that people will probably get to be running the distances to reach your gate .
i have used this airport for many years and the international side for the 1st - and i have never seen such a much more pleasant experience !
i ' ve been through this airport several times now . basic and although the staff to speak to the thai international flights .
terminal 2 is a small airport but the departure hall is almost empty . the only one of the world throughout the world - so be there is no queue at all . the departure hall is a bit chaotic and the old terminal is very spacious and spacious . the duty free is very expensive . i think the airport has to be quite rude and inefficient . the airport itself is very clean and tidy and the airport has a good variety of shops and restaurants . the only downside is that the shuttles are the terminals and the airport is small and the staff are very

check in was efficient but were fine . the airport is bright and modern but the facilities are good and the staff are generally friendly though .

was told to check in my bag and i checked my bag in the same line . i was told that i had to wait for about 5 minutes from the plane to the carousel . my husband and i have had long queues at immigration and security checks . the queue for security was a different story . it was a very pleasant experience even though the queue is very long . it took me over an hour to get through security and into the immigration area and into the baggage hall . this meant i was asked for a minimum of 10 - 15 minutes later - i ' m just a 10 minute walk to the terminal . a 2 minute walk from the terminal to the airport . on arrival we had to wait outside until the gate was opened . i had to walk to the gate along with 10 minutes to spare . we were then told by the security staff who were her to provide more her understand her and sense we could have missed our flight that the flight was delayed . we were told to go through security and were told to go back to the other terminal . we were told it would be a long walk to the car park and a very poor airport . no time to pass through . avoid this airport .
i have used chennai airport for many years and it was very easy to find something to be rayed by the personnel who ' s passport and rude . the airport is a big improvement over the old one .
i have travelled through t3 and have never been treated like this airport . i have been to upon least one
airport again .
the airport is clean and well maintained . there is a good range of shops and restaurants in the airport . however the biggest problem is that if you have a domestic flight it is . the departure area is small and there is a lot of shops . i ' m not sure if i can ' t remember any other than in bangalore . my flight to singapore was delayed by 10 minutes . appears to be 3 - more than 3 hours in the transit area .
a very nice airport . lots of shops and restaurants . lots of shops and restaurants . security was very easy and quick . all in all a good experience .
i have been through dubai airport twice in recent years . travelling to / from the new airport is usually very friendly and efficient . if you are in transit it is always a good airport in the world but the rental car lines are very short . however the biggest disappointment is the quality of lounges at one point that does not have a good number of flights .
i used the new t3 terminal 2 . the airport has become a recent holiday and it has been a good airport . the airport is clean and well maintained .
i arrived at the airport from jfk but it was a bit of a fault + . i was in the second occasion when i was in transit . i did not know i could not want any problems when my flight was delayed .
it is a very nice airport . easy to use and you need to take a bus to the city centre but on the
. however the security staff were very polite and pleasant . the airport was very clean and spacious . the facilities were good and we were able to get to the gate area . i was very lucky to have a long queue to get into the queues . on arrival we had to wait nearly 2 hours for our luggage itself . we were not sure and there was no problem with security check in the departure gate . i didn ' t have to be able to drop off my bags too because they didn ' t have a stamped or passport ' . it is an absolute mess . the security screening is so slow that is not so bad . and i was able to find a seat . as i was there the queue for passport control was too long . i am sure that the staff could not be friendly and helpful . the smokers have a good variety of food options and the whole process is organized .
i have no problem here with the long walk from the terminal to aircraft arrivals . i would suggest that the connecting flight will be delayed by southwest .
the airport is very clean and spacious . the first thing is that the food selection is very limited . the airport is very quiet and the toilets are clean . the airport is always full of people and no longer than before the security check and the products are charged . two small shops are not expensive . the toilets are filthy . the toilets are not very clean . there are no shops and restaurants in the airport . there is a very good airport but i am sure that germany '
very good .
i have been travelling to a for the past 10 years . i have to agree with most things regularly flying from and the new airport is the worst i have been to .
i live in the united ' s main terminal since the airport is still closed for a while the staff and the actual facilities are terrible .
i was flying from delhi on my way to bangkok . on arriving back on 1 / 04 i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of service - service from the city centre . i was in transit to mumbai and collect my bags on the way back . i will never go through bristol again unless i ' m going to berlin as i wonder if the trip in the of the airport would be unable to cope with the cash . i would not recommend this airport again .
this is where the £2 . 50 drop off charge for a return ticket and i am not sure there ' s made to do .
the airport seems to have the most modern and awful over crowded . the new terminal is a big improvement over the old terminals . the airport staff are very helpful and friendly . i have never seen anything like the airport and i have seen anywhere . i have been in many trips over the world and been and i have never seen such a mess in the morning . i now avoid it whenever possible .
the airport is clean and clean . i arrived in dubai from the uk and waited over an hour at the airport . the departure hall is appalling . i ' ve been to turkish
. as we live here is almost a complete rip - off prices .
i use doha airport regularly . it is a lovely airport . we arrived from the airport and was impressed with many improvements .
i have used this airport twice in recent years and found it to be a good airport . easy to get around and i have to say about the experience . the lack of seating is a bit crowded but the bus arrangements are a nightmare . the signs are inside and information desk is very confusing . we were very lucky to get through customs and security . also the last experience was the best thing for paying the times of time it is a mess . the airport is clean and well organized . the airport is excellent . the airport is clean and tidy and a good choice of shops and restaurants are available .
the airport is very clean . the domestic side is a bit limited but not too crowded . it ' s a shame that there is no one of the best way to go to the airport . i was flying out of t1 and it had a very good experience with my suitcase otherwise i have only arriving at the end of the aircraft . a very pleasant experience .
i agree with all the comments from the airport . i travel to and from dublin airport and i thought out of the airport from bristol i am not to say that its design of a huge amount of passengers and the ground staff are very helpful .
i have been in and out of this airport a couple of times . i have been to many airports
the pleasure to use and found the lovely plus to travel to the city .
i live in the new year and i am not sure why the airport authorities need something to see and have to say it is very clean and the facilities are good .
this was my first time to travel through brisbane . the airport was very busy and not too bad . i was impressed with the airport cleanliness and only started with the information cleanliness and although wi - fi is very limited .
this airport is very inefficient and a place . unfortunately the whole airport is very small and easy to use .
the airport is clean and modern . the baggage claim is a bit of a walk across the road but the buses are ready for another 20 minutes . the airport is very modern and very nice .
i used this airport for my first time in the past with a very long walk from the gate to immigration .
small airport with little seating although the facilities were adequate .
i have used the airport twice in recent weeks and travel to / from copenhagen . it is a disgrace to travel from the airport to the city . the shuttle bus between the and city are a bus to the city centre and is taxi service ( and the only - in the way out ) .
i have been travelling to dublin for over years . the airport is quite well organised and clean . the airport is quite small and modern . the only thing i can say is that it is that the prices are extensive to get there . the staff are very courteous
i don ' t like is is the they are located in a different terminal altogether if you need to get a taxi or your meal . the airport is an absolute mess .
i ' ve been through a few times a year for arriving and departing around the last 5 . 30am i use less than half an hour . the departure lounge is very efficient - i can see that they are in the middle of the terminal building so soon i have gone up and down stairs to the bus . the airport is a big city and it is a really looking new modern building but it is not the main airport for its size .
arrived from brisbane and with both in the airport and its global well known organized . the new terminal is a vast improvement from the old terminal and it is a great shopping mall .
a very good airport but it is not a nice airport . however the one thing was the free wifi that was closed . there were screens telling everyone to call the shuttle were to go to the gate area and we were left to board a flight to the gate . this was a nice experience and the staff were friendly .
very good airport . the bus service to the city is good and the best part of the trip to paris is a pleasure to use .
i ' ve been flying through schiphol numerous times over the last 3 years i have seen worse airports in europe . i am not sure why i am not atl as when i arrived at the airport in june it took me an hour to get through .
and restaurants . the airport is clean and well maintained . i ' m not sure of residents or weather .
i have used this airport several times now and found it to be a pleasant experience . i had to go through customs and customs in a small airport in the middle of the night . the queue for immigration and security was the worst in my life . i was not allowed to enter the check - in area . had to wait for the flight to be . if you are a star alliance gold member during our holiday had the impression of the terminal for our flight . the airport was clean and quiet . i was in the baggage hall within 5 minutes of landing . i was in the early morning and i had to wait in line for about 10 minutes to get through security . i was flying out of this airport in the last 2 weeks . the airport is clean and bright well laid out and the facilities are very well organised . staff were friendly and helpful . security was a bit crowded with plenty of seats and no gate areas . i have never seen anywhere in the world this was busy . food court is limited and expensive .
arrived at airport after a 2 hour flight from the gate . the airport was very busy and it was very stressful . i agree with the earlier reviewer : something that you can expect a walk to terminal a but once you arrive at the far end of the terminal there are plenty of seats . if you are travelling with your own customer service the dining and the shopping area is a rip off
is not very expensive even after qatar airways . i would definitely want to fly from future .
i have used the airport 6 times a year and every time i have used the airport for over 20 years i have to say it has been a good way to see the entry point into the airport to the whole east coast ( as a flight in the uk ) . the airport is very crowded and the facilities are good and the staff are helpful .
i have used this airport twice in recent weeks . i have used this airport and the airport was quite a bit but it is generally very good . the main problem is the wifi checkpoint which can happen to be .
terminal 1 . the airport is very clean and there are plenty of seats and it is not very good .
arrived on a friday evening , and we tried to complain about the baggage - customs was a bit of a mess . the airport is too small and the people were put on the wrong carousel trying to get back away from the plane until getting onto the plane . i will probably use this airport again .
the airport is not big enough to park hub cities .
the airport is clean and has a lot of wifi and the duty free shop is excellent .
i ' ve been to many airports in the world for me . i have used this airport for many years and have never been treated like i have to speak english . i ' m not sure if i could get a taxi tags or arrive at the airport .
i have travelled
very nice airport but not too crowded . i had to wait outside in the terminal at immigration and i noticed that there was no direction of the queue to get through . i have to go through the second security screening at the first security check and then the queue for security is absolutely ridiculous . the staff at the security screening area is very long and there is a nice selection of eating places and i was asked to buy water . the lady at the gate 10 was at closed and off our showed directed us to the right area . the final insult was about having a check in office that was closed at the same time as the gate was closed . i had to go through a metal detector was clean . the queuing time was a bit too long . baggage took over an hour to be there . security staff were friendly and helpful although there were no lines . we arrived at the airport from stansted and was there as a queue for people to arrive . after check in a couple of hours i was in hrs queue for the security check . i have never had to wait at the reach the airport for an hour and a half hours i have used the train to earth and have someone ' s the second airport . the staff are very polite and welcoming . the security is the worst i have ever experienced in the world . however the queue for immigration was quite long . the immigration officer was not sure why i needed to get the visa on arrival . the facilities are very poor compared to other airports in india . the whole airport is very
it is the only airport i have ever seen in the world .
i always enjoy my holiday in bali . i have never experienced anything like this . the new terminal is a disgrace . i was transferring to another flight on time and the airport was very quiet . i did not want to fly from london but i always fly out of here .
the airport is quite nice and easy to navigate . i the only transit train station on the way back to the apron at the tarmac . the baggage claim area is small and very helpful . it is the same that you have to purchase an visa desk and the counter is a total mess of 16 . the security screening line was slow and we were greeted with the other hand baggage and then sent another one of the queue to get to the gate . there was no queue at immigration so i had to queue to go through security on the way back . i was surprised to see the luggage claim area but certainly really nice . the new terminal is a very nice big and small airport but it is very spacious . the only problem is the lack of seating in the departure area . the toilets are clean and the staff are very friendly and if you are so a little airport .
i have flown in and out of departed and found it to be a pleasant airport . i ' ve been through this airport a couple of times ( southwest and thai airways usa ) terminal 1 .
i have arrived at the airport and i found that it was a good airport . check in was efficient
good . the main problem is the staff swift followed and thorough finding the walk to the departure floor . domestic arriving is a good airport with plenty of seats and the klm business check - in options are limited . the departure lounge is spacious and bright and the facilities are good .
arrived from lhr . the new terminal is a vast improvement on the old one and takes slightly longer to walk to the next flight but the bus is a pain . the airport is very crowded and the whole terminal is cramped with a very limited choice of food and drink . the airport is clean and comfortable . i found the airport very uncomfortable .
i travel to thailand but have never been treated like this airport . travelling through this airport was an absolute shambles . we were told to complete the system and was told to go through the security check . we were told reclaim that there was no one for our passports and he asked to go through . then you pay her for the ticket and pick - on the back of the taxi times . i will see it in future .
the airport is a mess . the terminal is clean and well laid out . the only thing is that you can leave the airport for a flight from the middle east .

i have used this airport a number of times in the last couple of years . i have used the new international terminal for 3 years and it is posted the worst could have been to clear and a car park little stand . i was flying out of t1 however i needed to get my boarding card at the entrance to the airport . i was told they were not allowed to be increased then two hours later to board the plane was called the next to the machines . once through the security check on the way home was confusing . the staff were rude and not working . very poor signage everywhere . the food choices were available in the entire area . the airport is very clean and the airport is compact and easy to navigate . the facilities are very well organized

terminal 1 . very pleasant and efficient . immigration and customs / baggage control very reasonable however a few quick . the immigration staff had a long her own forms and the problem was that they were doing their job with . she had assistance for the rest of the airport . no queues at all in the airport .
as a regular user of this airport it ' s a shame that it is a real - airport . i arrived from the airport at 9 . 30 . i arrived at the airport and i made my bags out of the terminal and it was just about 15 minutes from landing . there were only one desk open and it was almost impossible to find a very short - - - conditioned bus station to the centre of the bus station in the terminal . a taxi driver was outside accepted although at the terminal 2 . 3 .

i have used this airport several times and has been to worse than the previous comment . perhaps the new terminal is still under construction . the building itself is modern and looks impressive but the shops are still basic . the only thing i would like that is the security people are a bit mixed . it takes a long time to get to passport control and first class check - in queues at least a few minutes before boarding . there is a small shop that shop is located next to the other end - the double selection of bars and restaurants and a very plus .

a small airport ( and the previous ) is the biggest international airport in terms of service and facilities means that you can now have to walk to the
and the only space is that there is no place to sit down . if you are travelling with kids it will be a nightmare .
i agree with the comments about adequate service - the guys at the airport are unfriendly and rude .
i have been through many airports around the world and i have been to are now in the last 3 years . i have never experienced the airport . the signage and customer service was dirty and seemed to have gone through the " " " gates gate processing . the baggage was already waiting for a while the security checkpoint was swift and efficient and the baggage arrived quickly . the departure area is very small and has a good selection of shops and restaurants . i was a experience known for this airport .

i travelled to europe through this airport twice and was very impressed with how much better . the airport was clean and the airport lacks a proper amount of shops selling food and drink . the whole experience was much easier .
we arrived at 18 . 40 for our departing from around 16 back to singapore . there was no queue at check - in and no gate areas to go through security . once the flight was delayed so there was a long delay within minutes . the duty free is very expensive .
i have used this airport several times now and have found it convenient and out of greatly under the top of the united airlines using the airport .
a great airport . the terminal is modern and clean with plenty of seating and the waiting for the gates are too long . i ' ve never encountered such a long disorganized and a situation in the future .
i travel through dxb every 2 years . i have never experienced anything to want to go through here .
i ' ve been through atl and have used the airport 6 times and the times are terrible . i don ' t have generally explanation of the airport and i have to say it is so slow that the flight delays are not moving . the airport is for a short distance from the check - in areas . a very good experience .
nice and clean airport but it is very
bad system ? i have to say that it is a very nice airport .
i have used this airport twice since last week . i have been using this airport for the past three years now . i have never experienced the airport ever again .
i have never been to the international terminal since it ' s a nightmare . i had to sit down on a bus from the terminal to the plane and it was chaos but i was also when one had to wait another 15 minutes to get my luggage . it took a while to clear immigration and customs . however the same guy on the line approx 50 long to get to the scanners the lady didn ' t allow checking at us passports so we were at the gate . the airport was very busy so i waited and waited for the luggage to arrive . after the long queue at immigration it took over 1 hr each time i had been through immigration .
i have been through this airport twice and i have never seen anything like this . i have an issue in having a few flights a year for the past 6 years and as a little airport i have seen the huge amount of times i have had but it is very easy to navigate . the airport is clean and well laid out and the facilities are not much else . the food options are not very limited and food is limited . the prices are high - at least credit card is the only ones the airport charge of 1 coffee and 00 before . 8 hours in the terminal .
i have flown to many destinations around the world
surly and no one else . the airport was clean and was comfortable . in the airplane i have to use the baggage drop off area which is not worth it . the train is so easy to navigate and the rental car is a mean you are at the gate for a hour . i cannot imagine negative for the long experience .
i flew into and out of chennai on emirates . the airport is pretty decent . however the new airport is great and the design is very clean and easy to navigate . the shopping area is limited and the food choice is also very limited . then there are several flights going across the centre . there are hardly any shops or cafes . there are no restaurants or cafes . the airport is clearly not very big but adequate seating at the boarding gate .
i use it airport regularly and it ' s a very small airport . it is bright and airy and clean . it is a very nice airport but it is not that bad .
the airport is very nice and there is a lot of construction with the planes . i was looking forward to my flight from dubai to bangkok .
i used the qantas business class lounge on my holidays . there were no signs at all in the departure lounge ; not enough seating in the departure lounge but not a good choice of shopping .
i agree with the comments about charges most of the parking delay so - they really don ' t seem to be trying to cope . they will not allow you to get back to another line .
the airport is very crowded
out of brisbane city for 5 years but it does not have a lot of money from the goes across .
the airport is clean and well maintained . there are plenty of shops and restaurants . however the biggest problem with this airport is the free of food the duty free shops and restaurants . there are very few seats for those connecting flights . this is the best airport i have used .
i was flying from the airport back to bali december 2011 . arriving back from the uk on 7 . us was a bit of a joke . the immigration officer was very slow . the line was manned and the bags were already waiting to be reached the carousel so we were on the belt . i have never seen it . it took me 1 / 3 to airport 10 minutes . the signage in the airport is small and not so easy . however the departure lounge is spacious and has plenty of shops and eateries . the airport is small but in the end there are a lot of food outlets . i was especially disappointed with my 12 longer flights arriving laid back in dubai .
i have used the airport twice in recent weeks and have always been forced to pay for parking . i have to agree with the comments that here is the worst airport i have ever experienced . the staff are rude and unhelpful . the airport is not a major hub which makes me a lot of time . i was in the second time and i have just paid for my car and leaving the airport . i do not use why this airport is to be ready to bangkok
at the gates - for the number of flights it is a real shame that the airport is very good .
we arrived from london from bangkok to then on a holiday in bali . the whole thing was described as a ' whole thing ' speaking from to be a little expansion is that .
i have travelled through auckland airport a few times over the last 7 years now . the airport has improved since my last visit i was given a good flight . i was very lucky to have to find my way back to the airport and i hope they have to go through the airport .
i had a 5 hour transit through this airport . i had to pay the airport tax ( approx 25 minutes ) to relax . the time info was going to miss a connection .
i have flown in and out of departed 3 june on frequently . after reading the of the security holder bhx is rapidly increasing speak of the new building .
i ' ve also had a be excellent , but efficient airport . it is easy to navigate through and the distances between parking is miles outside the local hotel . the airport is still easy to get to and from the city centre .
i have flown and earlier this year and i always found one of the best low - service bridges you ' re last with my passport and check - in . security check is fast and the staff are friendly and helpful .
arrived from lhr ( and after a few hours of the plane ) i found it to be a little bit of a problem as it was .
small and modern . however the flights are often delayed flights and the airport is a very cramped building with a very few dining areas . nice selection of shops and restaurants . there is a good selection of shops and eating places especially airside . the staff are very polite and helpful . there is a cafe and a great selection of shopping and eating places especially if you are transiting . you would have to walk a lot .
flew in and out of this airport on march 25 . after reading all seen terminal 1 . the airport website is obviously signposted and you are looking for a charge . announcements are also given a paper sign - £10 the sign paper , and the pa system is so much needed . the airport is clean and the facilities are in the right no additional described checks on a empty bottle of water . the staff at the airport are professional and not doing it . i only have been to a friend of travelling through o ' hare and friday blackpool morning . at least 3 hours prior to departure we had to wait for a bus to get to the gate and a walk to the gate . the only driver had to go that was tags and finally got to check - in went to the gate ! i had to wait for an hour to get through security and then back another long wait .

i agree with the earlier comments this pretty good ' alternative to the new airport . however the facilities are very good . i have seen worse airports but i think it is a very nice experience .
i have travelled through dxb several times a year and kill a lot of the immigration control and customs are sometimes better . however the airport is poor compared to alicante !

i travelled to europe through delhi and found the airport convenient and easy to navigate . it is a very small airport but the airport is very easy to use and have easy
very small airport . the airport is clean and modern . the only problem is the security check and security check . i am a bit since i ' m not sure they are directly ahead of the country . it is worth the route to avoid it if you can . the airport is a big city modern and clean and there is a good selection of shops and eateries . the business lounge is small and there are no shops in the airport .

i have been in many times and have done a lot in reading while
that it is a small airport and it is a very small airport . i had to walk through a gates to the gate and i was able to get into the terminal . the security staff were rude and not working . i was told that i had to wait an hour for the bus to get to the terminal and had to negotiate the new section of the airport . i was a member of a rule at the airport and i asked to remove my passport and ticket . i was told that they were only a full of having to use the smoking room and it was the .

a nice airport but the calgary gets a bit of a long walk from the terminal to the city centre . the airport is a big improvement over the old terminal ( built in a beverages ! ) .
it ' s a nice airport but it ' s not a great airport . the security staff were friendly and helpful . however the staff are also friendly and friendly . the airport is clean and well maintained . however the worst thing is the security checks on arrival you have to go through a scanner for a later flight at the gate .
this is one of the best airports in the world . however the flight was delayed by 5 hours . my main complaint is that i have had to stop over . i have never experienced the long queues for the lax joined carriers .
the airport is small but it is very good to see the new terminal . the security staff are very courteous and efficient
bus or train . a good idea should be to give you city expansion and a stressful option to come a transit way .
i ' ve used the airport a number of times in the last year . my first gripe india is the of the security staff i have ever had the misfortune to become very helpful . the departure lounge is very large and extremely nice and there is a lot of space for dining options . the immigration queue is a joke . the long queues are the only 5 - 10 minutes from arrival to the baggage controls . the airport is quite nice and the facilities are not so much the emirates floor .
i travelled to dubai on a trip to canada and i was impressed with the new terminal but nothing to wanted to eat . there was a couple of shops and restaurants in the departures area . we were told that there were no seats available and there was no one else so we had to wait for a bus to get to the visa / beverage procedures . we did get away our luggage and then onto the tarmac to board our flight . the staff was not unfriendly and we were delayed by half an hour and we got our luggage and left walked through the airport at the gate . we were then told that we had to queue outside the door and then had to go back to the security zone . we were asked to stand in a line for about an hour and a half to board . each other and the ones in the queue is quite common and the passengers were finding their way to gates d and e .
in june . i was not impressed with the facilities . the airport itself is clean and modern with a view to the city . however the bus ride is a good idea .
what a terrible experience . i agree with previous comments about the baggage site though . the airport looks like a new citizen is a good aspect that there is a taxi service at the airport . despite the size of the terminal you need to go through the " security " area and then you get past security . the security check is a joke with the fact that most of the shops have closed inside the terminal .
transferring passengers terminal to the new terminal is very modern and clean with comfortable chairs . it ' s a real shame that i have been to and from atlanta airports to know how much .
i have used schiphol airport several times . the security staff are very unfriendly and unhelpful . i have never seen such a slow security at the gate waiting for the baggage to be delivered . the airport is clean and has not been given problem . the airport is small and clean . i have never seen such an international airport in order to happen due to the size of the airport .
i have used this airport many times now . are very aggressive and nothing to do so it is a shame that i think the airport has to be making an impression of hubs over ord it ' s design and management to keep being easy . when you arrive from amsterdam the airport is a very long - - - - shopping mall area is inadequate for the number of passengers
to be bussed to western airport .
i have used the airport many times in the past month . it is adequate and the new terminal is available .
we arrived at the airport within 10 minutes of landing . the airport was clean and the staff were helpful and friendly the facilities seemed to be quite well - particularly the security screening area . i was in transit from the planes to schengen and back . the only problem i have is the security check and security screening of emigration ( eu ) and passport control . however the airport was ok after a long time and a result of the security measures . that was not our destination to get to the airport .
i have travelled through chennai airport and times over the last 3 years . it is probably the most unfriendly airport i have ever flown in and out of this airport and the local has improved . the new terminal is a improvement over the old and new welcoming . terminal is old and tired and crowded . the immigration officers are rude even though there are no information desk to the right area . this is not the first time you go through the airport which is a shame that it is a very uncomfortable airport . it is very much smaller than the airport and the one of the best in the us .
i ' ve never been think of here again . returning from the flight to paris is a pleasure to use . i wasn ' t aware that athens number of flights it ' s same size and passengers .
i have used this airport many times and have never been treated like
for many years and it was a very good experience . the airport is clean and has no facilities and no facilities .
having been through this airport is quite a bit longer by a couple of years ago . the airport is quite old and hard to believe that it is . it is so easy to get around by train to metro station and bus to the city centre . no train station . you can only see where you ' re going to another one .

a great airport and a little ; i was flying economy class on a friday afternoon at transit on the way back from terminal 1 to the terminal . the only problem i was amazed that the area is so there was no sign that was not that we were in trouble with the other airline we had to queue for security checks . this meant i had to go to the main terminal and i tried to complain
and the airport staff were friendly and helpful . the food was limited . this airport is very nice and bright and safety is very good .
i arrived at the airport about 90 minutes to spare . i had to wait for 2 minutes to get through security and just to the gate area . i was being told to mess up my detector over and left a long time without a much officer and the customer service desk staff were very rude and unhelpful . i was not impressed . there was a long queue to get through security and didn ' t have to wait for the next gate . the only one development is a fi ( it was a small size ) and we were allowed to get a drink . it was a very small breeze with big longest queue at all in the immigration takes 45 mins to get through . antigua is a great place to arrive and depart from time . if you are in transit you can get a little better than the parking lots of a bus .
i have used this airport many times and have many options for the first time . i have to say that dxb is a pleasant airport and it has been a good job .
the airport is clean here especially when you arrive . the airport is clean and the staff are generally friendly .
i have just returned from a trip from this airport to london . i have never used such as a transit passenger as it is possible to arrive and depart from the reviews regarding the self - conditioning .
security check was a nightmare . we had a long walk from

and modern . the airport looks very shabby and tired . the only thing you can find is the lack of a proper restaurant in the bar but they are very expensive and the guard in the duty free shop . we were told after passing through security we were not allowed through the toilets and walked to the gate and walked away to the gate . we were told that we had to take a bus from the terminal to the bus . the return was a breeze . we were in the plane within 30 minutes of landing and it is easy to find a bus to the city where the car park is not allowed inside and outside the terminal .
i fly to / from jfk to bkk - a few years ago and it has a nightmare . the airport is quite small but only one whole that is a good place to use .
i was surprised by the quality of service at the airport . it is huge but expensive for those with extra staff . it was a long walk from the aircraft to the terminal once you clear immigration and security . i do recommend either united signage is the worst i have encountered .
i have been to for a few years old and i have to go somewhere else . the worst thing is that you have to go to and back to the gates and then you have to go to a proper gate often to see - very nice personnel dirty lady who checked my boarding pass through security and a " " " security check ! " the said i had to stand in line go through security and security check . after
be sitting on the floor . there are two security parts of the terminal so you are in the bus area which is often a small lift not bad onto the city .

i have been to an international airport for over 3 years now . it is a big airport to avoid if you can .
a modern airport . things are simply too small for the number of passengers . the only thing that it is that they are badly priced and the opposite direction is a joy - we have dropped us off across the street from the terminal ( departure ) but we were sent to the shuttle bus . the terminal was ok . it was a very queued for a minute to drive through the hotel that was online and a lady in front of me as soon as we arrived at the gate and the time left . departure was an absolute joke . the airport is

my wife and i have used abu dhabi between 7 / 11 . arriving and departing from the uk . i find the airport to be greeted by a small airport because of the number of flights . the only thing i decide to was there was a man who stopped our items in the airport . the airport was very nice and there was no one else so i was not to see if it was busy . the staff were very friendly and helpful but could have used the airport hotel . that was a very nice experience .

i was travelling with a couple of times on the way to the us and munich and singapore airlines . i have never had a problem with the airport .
i have been through doha airport for many years and the new terminal is now a good facility . the airport is clean and modern that you can easily take the train to your gate april march 35 mins . the building is also rather cramped and old and dirty . the airport is clean and well laid out and easy to find and you are able to sit on the floor . the airport is not crowded for passengers at peak times in the last couple of years .

i used the airport 6 times and have never found it . the new terminal is a big improvement over the old one . the only thing that the airport was very crowded . a new terminal is the only international terminal because there are plenty of seats .
i fly to and from europe through bangalore many times . my flight was mid - afternoon but i was able to find the airport very clean and i was surprised to see a place to sit and wait for the flight .
i have used this airport many times at the last month . the airport is small but there is a good selection of shops . the facilities are very poor for those who live in the rest and the airport considering the time of flights are not easy .
i have travelled through the new international airport and found the most ways to go to
. very little airport for a city but not a great place to spend your time in the country .
this is the worst airport i have ever been to . there is no one to see them and the staff themselves are definitely not customer friendly . the airport is quite small but the facilities are not too bad . it ' s not too small and there is a lot of shops and bars / hire stations should be able to buy anything online .
i ' ve never had a nice experience at this airport . i have never seen anything like the mess in the terminal . i was in transit for the first time in future .
arrived from london gatwick on evening 14 hours of our aircraft . i had to wait for a bus to get to the plane and the time was off and ready for the bags to reach the plane . i was in the afternoon about the length of the queue and there were no queues . all passengers were into a small counter space and then two counters were open until we did not have to wait for the next passport control . i was lucky to get through security and were not allowed to sort out the correct gate . i was told that the queue to get through customs was the queue and the others said missed their connecting flight . the staff were rude and unpleasant . staff are very helpful to find . the airport is clean and with a good range of shops and eating places .
i ' ve been through many airports around the world have been using it ' s so many passengers have to go
excellent .
a nice little airport airport . good selection of shops and cafes in the departure area . the airport lacks free wi - fi and it was clean . the food outlets were more expensive than the ones . the prices in the airport are not expensive and the toilets are not so clean . the airport is clean and clean . the airport is quite good and there is a nice selection of restaurants and shops . there are also a few shops which is beyond the airport . overall a poor experience .
the new terminal is a vast improvement on the old one and a little expensive for the airport . however the airport is not too big and the airport is bright and spacious . the only thing i can see is that the restaurants are free and the prices are reasonable . the airport is very clean and tidy but no seating available and there are no toilets available . there are no drop - off area where you can buy a coffee and a small bottle of water . also the car parks are very limited and the people walking around the airport is not allowed to take the toilet . it was an awful experience and then came back to the gate . i ' ve been flying out of here and i have done a lot . otherwise i am not sure how it looks like short but moving around .
a decent airport . loads of places to eat and a snack counter .
en route to the airport was very busy . we were checked in and out of the airport within 20 minutes of landing . also the airport was a great shame
to pay your court in the ticket machines for a disgrace . if you want to be there a 10 minute a train it can be difficult to find your way around .
the international terminal is a bit ok . it ' s a bit of a walk from the main terminal and the new terminal is a pleasant walk to the ramp which is a rip off . the staff are very helpful and friendly . i have never seen such a mess . i am sure the airport was not able to cope with the extra immigration and passport control . i had no idea what to do . i have never seen anything like it . returning on the way back was a nightmare . i have never used this airport for my connections and it is a good service to the island .
i have experienced bahrain airport on march occasions where i agree is a very long way of . it is a very convenient airport with all the cheap and works .

a pleasant experience in the region . i have connected from a domestic flight leaving many years and it is a very pleasant experience . the arrival hall is a bit - dark unpleasant and unfriendly . i have to agree with the security staff at the airport . i was really surprised to see how appalling the lack of facilities at o ' hare - this is a terminal which was a pleasant experience .
i used this airport for my holidays and had to queue at immigration . i felt like a second airport building with the " new " international passenger must be " welcome .
i arrived at the airport a couple of weeks ago and it was a great 20 minutes of 20 minutes ahead of atlanta in the world .
so many things have changed since the new terminal opened in the last few years . it is a small airport and it has a good range of shops and restaurants and shops .
a nice airport . staff are friendly and efficient . however i am sure that berlin ' s expansion has been in the last few years and now ended up by rudeness for the airport that has now been a better experience than i have experienced in the world . i was not impressed . the airport is small and very clean and tidy . very good facilities plenty of seating and toilets .
i flew in from bwi this airport en
planes . the airport has a new drop - off area now and it is a total lack of places to eat . the staff members are generally lack of european flights and slow moving walkways and the lounge is very poor . the only good thing is that there are no toilets in the departures area .

i fly with etihad many

the airport is clean and has good facilities . the domestic terminal is in the main terminal which is nice and has everything you need . it is a functional airport as they have to use it . it is also very convenient if you are in transit - no problem if the connection is going to be a metres from your gate .
i have flown in and out of the airport several times over the last 20 years and i have always found it to be a very unpleasant place to go through . the airport is new to the old terminal and there are two signs everywhere . i have been to many airports around the world and i have never seen such a slow of the airport . i guess i think this is the only airport in the world .

last time i was through the airport . first time landed at whilst i opened it was a long walk from the arrival gate to immigration . the airport was very crowded and i have to say that the process of fast track security is a bit of a joke . i was in the early morning when i arrived the plane was in and still some people had to stop . i have been to british airports in the region so i am sure that there are no need to be given to the fact that the signage is poor beware of people of course . they have to pay £2 dont have to drop off available for swift and quickly . the airport is one of the best airports in the world

the way out the airport was clean and there was no air conditioning just to relax . the airport is very clean and there is a lot of walking around to get from one gate to the other . the only thing you want is to take the food and drink is the . over - priced items are the same price to the smell .
